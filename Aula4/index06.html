        <blockquote cite="https://supernatural.fandom.com/wiki/Dean_Winchester/Quotes">That's not the same thing. A wise man once told me, "Family don't end in blood." But it doesn't start there, either. Family cares about you, not what you can do for them. Family's there through the good, the bad-all of it. They got your back, even when it hurts. That's family. That sound like your mother? - Dean Winchester</blockquote>
